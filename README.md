# ECS 162 Starter React App on Glitch

This app has a set-up that allows you to use React on Glitch, as part of an
Express server.

It is packaged with Webpack, and set up so that your edits to your code will (slowly) deploy and
update live.. It is based on Glitch's own
[starter kit](https://glitch.com/~starter-react).

Notice that the jsx components, which get transpiled (compiled), are in app/, while the usual html and
css files are in public/. bundle.js is the JS output file made by Webpack, do not try to edit it.


## By [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

Glitch is the friendly commmunity where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
